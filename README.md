# Maze Game ALX SE PROGRAM PORFOLIO PROJECT 

This is a simple 3D game built using raycasting technique with SDL2 library in C programming language.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using raycasting. The game consists of navigating through a map represented in 2D with walls and obstacles. The player can rotate the camera, move forward, backward, and sideways to explore the environment.

## Features

- Drawing walls using raycasting technique.
- Player rotation and movement.
- Collision detection with walls.
- Map parsing from a file.
- Drawing the map on the screen.
- Textures for walls, ground, and ceiling.
- Weapon textures.
- Enemy entities.
- Rain effect with toggling.

## Dependencies

- SDL2 library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile the code:

## Map Format

The map is represented as a grid where each character denotes a specific element:

- 'W': Wall
- ' ': Empty space

Example map file (`map.txt`):
